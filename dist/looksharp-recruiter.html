Their<span class="strong">managers</span>were starting to think about trying to figure out which event performed best, but had no idea how to think about the problem.</p><p><span class="strong">The students</span>felt the entire process was forced, superficial, and generally dream crushing. Printing their resume, trying to stand out in a public, forced environment, and hoping to hear anything back from anyone was incredibly frustrating.</p><div class="handwritten-box"><h5>From My Notes:</h5><p>1. On-campus recruiting exists because it always has. Nobody is questioning the practicality or thinking analytically about it.</p><p>2. The subjective assessment of a student's "fit" with a company is the only valuable and unique aspect of on-campus recruiting.</p><p class="no-margin">3. Resume collection and follow-up are incredibly painful. Recruiters scribble notes on hundreds of paper resumes and scan them into their system later.</p></div><p class="prepend-2"><span class="strong">It was clear that these were problems that were well aligned with our mission to launch the career of every student.</span>These were problems we should be solving.</p></div></div></section><section><div class="row"><div class="columns small-12 medium-10 medium-centered large-8 large-centered"><h3 class="sub-header">Solving the Problems</h3><p>With such a broad set of problems available to solve, it was difficult to know where to start. I led ideation sessions with the team that produced plentry of great ideas ranging from services provided by universities to facilitate smoother information exchange to mobile apps that help employers and students connect and exchange data.</p><p>Ultimately, we felt that given our team's skillset we felt that<span class="strong">this was a prime opportunity for us to build a mobile app to help facilitate the exchange of information and capture the recruiter's subjective analysis of the student.</span></p><p>At the time, the biggest design challenge we then faced was figuring out how to get the student's resume (or coursework and work history data) in the employer's hands. We experimented with text-based exchanges, custom portable scanners, and all manners of complicated systems. We landed on a simple system that required the employer to enter the student's email address into a mobile app and we'd follow-up with an email to the student asking them to upload their resume.<span class="strong">This modification of the typical</span></p></div></div></section><section><div class="row"><div class="columns small-12 medium-10 medium-centered large-8 large-centered"><h3 class="sub-header">Fleshing Out the Plan</h3><p>Changing our business model was going to be a costly investment, so the first task was to ensure that the idea resonated with our employer audience.

In other words, we were delivering 40% of the maximum number of applicants, or actualizing 40% of the potential revenue available to us.</p><p>We began to test ideas for growing both the available budget and the rate at which the positions were applied for. We tested the syndication of these listings out to other marketplaces (Indeed, etc.), tweaked our search algorithm to boost these postings on our marketplace, and started sending out highly personalized emails to potential applicants for these positions.
