Water utilities were already motivated to reduce consumer water usage due to government legislation that would penalize them if they failed to reduce water consumption by 20% by 2020.</p><p>That left the consumers as the major mystery.<span class="strong">I kicked off the project by reaching out to people across the country to understand their awareness of their water usage, the importance of convservation, and what actions they were taking to modify their water consumption.</span></p><!--%ul--><!--%li--><!--%p.no-margin How aware consumers were of their water usage--><!--%ul--><!--%li--><!--%em What information did they know off the top of their head?--><!--%li--><!--%em What were their actual usage numbers?--><!--%li.prepend-2--><!--%p.no-margin How important water conservation actually was to them--><!--%ul--><!--%li--><!--%em Why did they believe water conservation was important / unimportant?--><!--%li--><!--%em What actions supported their claims?--><!--%li.prepend-2--><!--%p.no-margin What information they were getting about their usage and from whom--><!--%ul--><!--%li--><!--%em Where these sources trustworthy?

It would provide access to real-time water usage data, competitive comparisons (to push to achieve 'average' consumption), and a concept of a built-in farming game for the kids in a family that would teach them about water conservation and usage. Their performance in the game would depend on their household's actual usage. I also created a login experience that leveraged 'priming' and the user's inherent curiosity to drive account creation.</p></div></div><div class="row"><div class="columns small-12 medium-12 large-10 large-centered"><img src="/assets/img/dropcountr-app.png" class="center-img" /></div></div><div class="row"><div class="columns small-12 medium-10 medium-centered large-8 large-centered"><p class="prepend-2">I then focused on creating a compelling weekly email that used leaderboards and anchoring to engage consumers on a recurring basis and encourage them to open the mobile application and engage with the game.</p></div></div><div class="row"><div class="columns small-12 medium-12 large-10 large-centered"><img src="/assets/img/dropcountr-email.png" class="center-img" /></div></div><div class="row"><div class="columns small-12 medium-10 medium-centered large-8 large-centered"><p class="prepend-2">Finally, I moved on to designing the push notification experience that would engage the users when usage anomalies were detected, goal progress was made on conservation goals, game progress was made, or bills were due.</p></div></div><div class="row"><div class="columns small-12 medium-12 large-10 large-centered"><img src="/assets/img/dropcountr-push-notifications.jpg" class="center-img" /></div></div></section><section class="append-2"><div class="row"><div class="columns small-12 medium-10 medium-centered large-8 large-centered"><h3 class="sub-header">Key Takeaways & Reminders</h3><div class="handwritten-box"><p>Changing human behavior without inherent motivation is extremely difficult.
