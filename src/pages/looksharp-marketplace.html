However, it was inconsistent and inefficient.</p><p class="prepend-2">We had some smaller self-serve customer posting jobs and making 1-off hires. We were charging $99 for a 30-day job posting and generating $1,800/month. We knew that if we wanted to become profitable, we would have to better monetize our self-serve audience.<span class="strong">Thus, this project was driven primarily by a business need, not a user need.</span></p></div></div></section><section><div class="row"><div class="columns small-12 medium-10 medium-centered large-8 large-centered"><h3 class="sub-header">Observation and Problem Definition</h3><p>I knew we needed to better understand why employers weren’t paying to post on our site. Conversations with our self-serve employers revealed<span class="strong">the largest current hurdles to paying to post positions on Looksharp.com:</span></p><p><ul><li><p class="no-margin">They could go elsewhere to post for free.</p></li><li><p class="no-margin">The reluctance to pay $99 for 30 days of exposure when you might get 1 applicant or 200 applicants.</p></li></ul></p></div></div></section><section><div class="row"><div class="columns small-12 medium-10 medium-centered large-8 large-centered"><h3 class="sub-header">Going Broad: Solving the Problem</h3><p>We quickly nixed the idea of going completely free. We had tried that in the past and while it stimulated marketplace growth, it didn't generate revenue. After additional brainstorming with the team,<span class="strong">we coalesced around the idea of switching to a pay-per-applicant model.</span></p><p>This model would allow us to do 2 things. First, it aligned our business model with our customer's needs. We would generate revenue by driving quality applicants to these positions, which is what these employers were paying us to deliver. Second, it removed some uncertainty and fear from the posting process for employers. They would only pay for results.</p><div class="handwritten-box"><h5>Goal</h5><p>Increase revenue from self-serve employer job postings.</p><h5 class="prepend-2">Strategy</h5><p class="no-margin">1.

Unfortunately, it wasn't the easiest model to explain to the average SMB owner. They were used to paying a flat rate and understanding a new model was an overwhelming task.</p><p>Where I didn't expect them to get hung up was in setting a budget for their position. It took many iterations to figure out the best way to communicate the idea of usage-based payment.</p></div></div><div class="row"><div class="columns small-12 medium-12 large-10 large-centered"><img src="/assets/img/ls-self-serve-900x542.jpg" class="center-img" /></div></div></section><section><div class="row"><div class="columns small-12 medium-10 medium-centered large-8 large-centered"><h3 class="sub-header">The Launch</h3><p>After iterating through sketches and getting input on the most confusing aspects of the model switch, I dove into higher fidelity designs.</p></div></div><div class="row"><div class="columns small-12 medium-12 large-10 large-centered"><div class="row small-up-1 medium-up-3 gallery"><div class="column"><a href="#" data-featherlight="/assets/img/ls-self-serve-postings-dash.png" class="thumbnail"><img src="/assets/img/ls-self-serve-postings-dash.png" class="center-img" /></a></div><div class="column"><span href="#" class="thumbnail"><img src="/assets/img/ls-self-serve-postings-create.png" class="center-img" /></span></div><div class="column"><span href="#" class="thumbnail"><img src="/assets/img/ls-self-serve-postings-payment.png" class="center-img" /></span></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="columns small-12 medium-10 medium-centered large-8 large-centered"><p class="prepend-2">We quickly built and launched with the basic pay-per-applicant model extremely quickly and found quite a bit of success.<span class="strong">Within the first month after launch we began seeing $400 days (up from $60 days with the previous model).</span></p><p>After the initial launch it became painfully clear through product feedback channels that we still had at least 1 major concern to address on the behalf of employers - the quality of applicants.<span class="strong">Employers were concerned that we were simply going to go find just anyone on the internet to apply to their position and then charge them for it.</span></p><p>In response, we quickly iterated into an applicant restrictions feature that allowed employers, for a slight increase in cost, to restrict who could apply for their positions.

In other words, we were delivering 40% of the maximum number of applicants, or actualizing 40% of the potential revenue available to us.</p><p>We began to test ideas for growing both the available budget and the rate at which the positions were applied for. We tested the syndication of these listings out to other marketplaces (Indeed, etc.), tweaked our search algorithm to boost these postings on our marketplace, and started sending out highly personalized emails to potential applicants for these positions. The result?<span class="strong">We drove the fill rate up to 70% and pushed our monthly recurring revenue from self-serve to $11k (from $1.8k).</span></p></div></div><div class="row"><div class="columns small-12 medium-12 large-10 large-centered"><img src="/assets/img/self-serve-rev-graph.svg" class="center-img" /><hr /><a href="/" class="float-left">Homepage</a><a href="#" class="float-right">Next Project</a></div></div></section></div></article></main>
