However, it was inconsistent and inefficient.</p><p class="prepend-2">We had some smaller self-serve customer posting jobs and making 1-off hires. We were charging $99 for a 30-day job posting and generating $1,800/month. We knew that if we wanted to become profitable, we would have to better monetize our self-serve audience. <span class="strong">Thus, this project was driven primarily by a business need, not a user need.</span> </p></div></div></section><section><div class="row"><div class="columns small-12 medium-10 medium-centered large-8 large-centered"><h3 class="sub-header">Observation and Problem Definition</h3><p>I knew we needed to better understand why employers weren’t paying to post on our site.

We had tried that in the past and while it stimulated marketplace growth, it didn't generate revenue. After additional brainstorming with the team, <span class="strong">we coalesced around the idea of switching to a pay-per-applicant model.</span> </p><p>This model would allow us to do 2 things. First, it aligned our business model with our customer's needs. We would generate revenue by driving quality applicants to these positions, which is what these employers were paying us to deliver. Second, it removed some uncertainty and fear from the posting process for employers. They would only pay for results.</p><div class="handwritten-box"><h5>Goal</h5><p>Increase revenue from self-serve employer job postings.</p><h5 class="prepend-2">Strategy</h5><p class="no-margin">1.
