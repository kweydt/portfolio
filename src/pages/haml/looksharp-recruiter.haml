              Employers were still inefficiently spending loads of money to blindly travel across the country to select schools, staff a booth at a career fair, and get their opportunity to pitch their company to thousands of students that weren't great fits.

              We knew that on-campus recruiting was an antiquated and incredibly painful and inefficient process for both students and employers.
              %span.strong I headed onto some local campuses and snuck into several career fairs in an effort to observe and speak with both recruiters and students.

              were frustrated with the inefficiency of on-campus recruiting and feeling overworked. Their

              were starting to think about trying to figure out which event performed best, but had no idea how to think about the problem.

              felt the entire process was forced, superficial, and generally dream crushing. Printing their resume, trying to stand out in a public, forced environment, and hoping to hear anything back from anyone was incredibly frustrating.

              %h5 From My Notes:
              %p 1. On-campus recruiting exists because it always has. Nobody is questioning the practicality or thinking analytically about it.
              %p 2. The subjective assessment of a student's "fit" with a company is the only valuable and unique aspect of on-campus recruiting.
              %p.no-margin 3. Resume collection and follow-up are incredibly painful. Recruiters scribble notes on hundreds of paper resumes and scan them into their system later.
            %p.prepend-2
              %span.strong It was clear that these were problems that were well aligned with our mission to launch the career of every student.
              These were problems we should be solving.

            %p
              With such a broad set of problems available to solve, it was difficult to know where to start. I led ideation sessions with the team that produced plentry of great ideas ranging from services provided by universities to facilitate smoother information exchange to mobile apps that help employers and students connect and exchange data.
            %p
              Ultimately, we felt that given our team's skillset we felt that
              %span.strong this was a prime opportunity for us to build a mobile app to help facilitate the exchange of information and capture the recruiter's subjective analysis of the student.
            %p
              At the time, the biggest design challenge we then faced was figuring out how to get the student's resume (or coursework and work history data) in the employer's hands. We experimented with text-based exchanges, custom portable scanners, and all manners of complicated systems. We landed on a simple system that required the employer to enter the student's email address into a mobile app and we'd follow-up with an email to the student asking them to upload their resume.

            %p Where I didn't expect them to get hung up was in setting a budget for their position. It took many iterations to figure out the best way to communicate the idea of usage-based payment.

              We quickly built and launched with the basic pay-per-applicant model extremely quickly and found quite a bit of success.
              %span.strong Within the first month after launch we began seeing $400 days (up from $60 days with the previous model).
            %p
              After the initial launch it became painfully clear through product feedback channels that we still had at least 1 major concern to address on the behalf of employers - the quality of applicants.
              %span.strong Employers were concerned that we were simply going to go find just anyone on the internet to apply to their position and then charge them for it.
            %p In response, we quickly iterated into an applicant restrictions feature that allowed employers, for a slight increase in cost, to restrict who could apply for their positions. If a student on our site wasn't qualified to apply for their position, they wouldn't even see it in search results.

            %h3.sub-header Iterative Improvement
            %p Given the success of the pay-per-applicant model, the clear next step was to find ways to iteratively grow the available budget in our marketplace from these postings and drive additional quality applicants to those positions.
            %p Initially, we were filling about 40% of the budget we had available to fill from self-serve postings. In other words, we were delivering 40% of the maximum number of applicants, or actualizing 40% of the potential revenue available to us.
            %p
              We began to test ideas for growing both the available budget and the rate at which the positions were applied for. We tested the syndication of these listings out to other marketplaces (Indeed, etc.), tweaked our search algorithm to boost these postings on our marketplace, and started sending out highly personalized emails to potential applicants for these positions. The result?
              %span.strong We drove the fill rate up to 70% and pushed our monthly recurring revenue from self-serve to $11k (from $1.8k).
